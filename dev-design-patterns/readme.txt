Design Patterns types:
* Factory: Define a interface for creating an object, but defer object instantiation to run time.
* Model View Controller(MVC): It's an UI pattern, intended to separate internal representations of
    data from the ways it is presented to/accepted from the users.
** Lib: Flassk: a python web framework
* Facade
* Proxy
* Decorator
* Adaptor
* Command: Decouple the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
    * Interpreter
    * State
    * Chain of responsibility
* Observer: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its
    dependents are notified and updated automatically
* TBD
